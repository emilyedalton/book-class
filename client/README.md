## React Book Finder 

This [project](https://dry-cove-87436.herokuapp.com/) is  React-based Google Books Search app that searches books by Northwestern University Press. This app uses React components,  with helper/util functions, and utilizes React lifecycle methods to query and display books based on user searches. It also uses Node, Express and MongoDB so users can save books to adopt for couses or purchase at a later date.  

This app attempts to address the issue of discovery of titles and improved sales through course adoption in scholarly publishing.
